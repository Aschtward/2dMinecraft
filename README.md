# 2dMinecraft
This is a 2d game that i've being doing inspired on minecraft
I've done this while  trying to learn some procedural world generation. Turns out that i learned a lot about perlin noise, but decided to not use here.
If you go through the code you'll see there's a really bad world generation method, but i intended to mantain this simple, and i used some code to smooth my world. You can check that out looking for cave generation.
There's a lot missing to be a actual game, like:
-Enemies.
-Craft system.
-Mine system.
-Food system.
-Water system.
But as i'm having a lot of tests on my college i decided to upload this way and move on to the next project.
Here are some screenshots.
